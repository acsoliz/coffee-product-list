# Section 2: Performance Optimization

## Identifying Potential Bottlenecks

### 1. Large Bundle Size
- **Issue**: A large bundle size can slow down the initial load time of the application.
- **Solution**: Use code splitting and lazy loading to load only the necessary parts of the application when needed.

### 2. Unoptimized Images
- **Issue**: Large and unoptimized images can significantly impact the load time and performance.
- **Solution**: Use optimized image formats (e.g., WebP) and lazy load images to improve performance.

## Proposed Solutions

### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- **Implementation**: Use React's `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to split the code and load components only when needed.

### Image Optimization
- **Implementation**: Use tools to optimize images and implement lazy loading for images using the `loading="lazy"` attribute.


## Conclusion
By addressing these potential bottlenecks and implementing the proposed solutions, we can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of the Coffee Product List application, providing a better user experience.
